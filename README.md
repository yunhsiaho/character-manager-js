# Character-manager-js

Character manager is a group project made by Josue and Hsia. It's a challenge asigned by BECODE LIEGE code training center. We had been working on this from 01/03/2021-05/03/2021 to learn about the teamworking pattern and consolidate our knowledges in the codes we've learned.

# The mission
A Comics fan client would like to manage his favorites characters on a dashboard. He contacts us to create an app that will be able to view, edit, create all his favorites characters.

In this project, we use the Character Database API to make/fetch a Character Manager. This project ask us to perform HTTP Request.

The root endpoint of the API is the following : ![https://character-database.becode.xyz/](https://character-database.becode.xyz/ )
